Despite recent advances in vasodilator therapy for PAH, more effective treatments are needed. PK10571 has not been previously studied in humans. 1.1.1 Pharmacology PK10571 is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has shown efficacy in animal models of PAH. The following studies of PK10571 have been performed: â¢ In vitro kinase assays â¢ In-cell Westerns to measure inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGFBB) stimulated AKT (also known as protein kinase B) phosphorylation â¢ Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to estimate IC50 for inhibition of phosphorylation of PDGF receptors in human lung fibroblasts â¢ Endothelial cell permeability assays â¢ Human ether-Ã -go-go-related gene (hERG) channel activity assay â¢ Metabolism study in human hepatocytes â¢ Biliary excretion study â¢ Metabolism in lung microsomes â¢ Preclinical efficacy study in the rat monocrotaline plus pneumonectomy model â¢ Preclinical efficacy study in the rat Sugen 5416 (SU5416) hypoxia model â¢ Platelet aggregation studies PK10571is well absorbed from the lung in both rats and dogs and accumulation did not appear to be an issue in either species.

Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 343 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final 1.2 Dose Selection Rationale The first in human exposure of PK10571 will be a single dose ranging study followed by multiple dose (7 day) administration in healthy volunteers. The results from the preclinical program were used to select the starting dose for this phase IA clinical trial. The starting dose is based on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry âEstimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteersâ dated July 2005.

Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 346 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final Escalation will be carried out with careful clinical monitoring and in accordance with dose escalation and halting rules described in the protocol. It should be noted that if a higher maximum dose of is warranted in the clinical trial, the nonclinical data would also support this dose with an animal:human dose multiple of 15. 1.3 Study Rationale Because PAH represents a serious orphan medical condition with a critical need for better therapies, Gossamer Bio, Inc. plans to work closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in order to ensure an efficient development program. Gossamer Bio, Inc. will evaluate PK10571 in an initial Phase 1A single-dose/multiple-dose study in normal, healthy volunteers, . Part A of the phase 1A study is a single ascending dose (SAD) double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of inhaled dry powder PK10571 in healthy human volunteers for determination of safety. Part A will consist of at least 4 cohorts and up to 5 cohorts. Within each cohort, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either active drug or placebo. The initial dose will be determined based on the results of animal toxicology studies. After completion and review of the SAD trial (Part A), the multiple ascending dose (MAD) clinical trial (Part B) will be performed. The MAD clinical trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized repeat dose trial of inhaled dry powder PK10571 in healthy human volunteers. There will be up to 3 dose cohorts, and within each cohort subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either active drug or placebo. Study subjects will be administered active drug or placebo once daily for 7 days. Gossamer Bio, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 31 Jul 2018 Page 11 GB002, Inc. Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 347 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final 2 OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study are: â¢ To determine the safety and tolerability of single ascending inhalation doses of PK10571 formulated as a dry powder with excipient L-leucine in healthy adult subjects (Part A) â¢ To determine the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending inhalation doses of PK10571 formulated as a dry powder with excipient L-leucine in healthy adult subjects (Part B) â¢ To evaluate the bioavailability of PK10571 following single- and multiple-dose regimens â¢ 3 STUDY DESIGN SUMMARY This is a first-in-human, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-part study in healthy adult males and females of non-childbearing potential. Because the safety profile of PK10571 in humans is unknown and this is the first clinical study to assess PK10571 in humans, a single-ascending dose escalation design will be used in Part A of the study. Part B will be a multiple-ascending dose escalation design, to be run only after review of safety and pharmacokinetic data from Part A. In the single ascending dose study (Part A) at least 4 dose levels of PK10571 will be tested: An optional fifth dose level of up to may be added, based on safety and pharmacokinetic data from the first 4 cohorts. Subjects will be randomized into one dose cohort and receive either PK10571 or placebo. Within each cohort, 6 subjects will receive active drug and 2 subjects will receive placebo. In the multiple ascending dose study (Part B), up to three dose levels of PK10571 will be tested. The daily dose will be administered daily for 7 days with close clinical monitoring. The dose for the first cohort of Part B will be determined by review of the safety and pharmacokinetic data from Part A by the Safety Review Committee. The dose interval for the first cohort of Part B (i.e., once daily, twice daily, or up to three times daily) will be determined by review of the safety and pharmacokinetic data from Part A by the Safety Review committee. Subsequent doses and dosing intervals will be determined by review of the safety and pharmacokinetic data from the prior cohort. Gossamer Bio, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 31 Jul 2018 Page 12 GB002, Inc. Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 348 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final For both Part A and Part B, for each cohort, randomization will occur in 2 blocks as follows: In the first block, 2 subjects (sentinel subjects) will be randomized 1:1 to receive PK10571 or placebo; in the second block, 6 subjects will be randomized 5 PK10571: 1 placebo. If PK10571 is well-tolerated in the sentinel subjects, the remainder of the cohort (n = 6) will be randomized. There will be a minimum of 48 hours between dosing of the 2 sentinel subjects and the remainder of the cohort. The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of PK10571 will be evaluated in each sequential cohort prior to each dose cohort escalation, assessing the totality of all the safety data prior to initiating the next cohort. Gender distribution will be based on sequential screening of volunteers who meet entry criteria, with a minimum of 4 females per cohort, in order to ensure 2 females per active dose group. Subjects will be assigned numbers in an ascending order, based on successful completion of the screening process. Each subject will participate in only one cohort. Subjects who withdraw from the study may be replaced at the discretion of the Principal Investigator and Sponsor. Replacement subjects will be given a new randomization number in the 9000 series and assigned to the same treatment as the subject they replace. Safety assessments will include adverse events; vital signs; oxygen saturation; physical examination; 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG); clinical laboratory examinations; and pulmonary function tests (spirometry). Blood and urine will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Blood will be collected for buffy coat analysis. 3.1 Part A Part A of the study is a single ascending dose study design. Up to 5 dose levels will be studied. Subjects will receive either PK10571 or placebo. Part A will enroll up to 40 subjects; 8 subjects per cohort. The data from each cohort will be analyzed before deciding whether to proceed with the next cohort. Each cohort will include a sentinel group of 2 subjects (1 active and 1 placebo) who will be dosed at least 48 hours before the remaining subjects (5 active and 1 placebo). Dosing of the remaining subjects will occur following a safety evaluation of the sentinel group. Gossamer Bio, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 31 Jul 2018 Page 13 GB002, Inc.

Plasma pharmacokinetic samples will be analyzed for PK10571 using a validated analytical method. Appropriate pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated for each formulation using non-compartmental methods. Subjects will be housed at the clinical research site for observation until Day 9 (48 hours after the last dose) and return to the clinical research site for safety evaluation and pharmacokinetic blood collection on Days 10, 14, and 35. 3.3 Safety Review Team A Safety Review Committee consisting of the Principal Investigator or designee (e.g., a medically qualified sub-investigator) and Sponsor representatives with appropriate expertise will meet and review, at minimum, the 24-hour safety data for the sentinel group of each cohort in Part A prior to dosing the remainder of the cohort. The Safety Review Committee will review the safety and pharmacokinetic data from each cohort in Part A. Dose escalation to the next level will occur only after review of the 24-hour pharmacokinetic data, and safety data up to and including Day 11 from the preceding cohort(s). The factors to be used in determining the next incremental dose are described in Section 3.4. There will be at least 2 weeks between dosing of each cohort. The Safety Review Committee will review the safety and pharmacokinetic data of Part A before starting Part B. The pharmacokinetic data from the first 24 hours of Part B, Cohort 1 up to and including Day 7, and the safety data up to and including Day 14 will be reviewed prior to dosing of Part B, Cohort 2. All available safety data will be assessed prior to each dose escalation, including but not limited to the following: â¢ All adverse events (AEs) â¢ Safety laboratory tests (i.e., hematology, chemistry and urinalysis) â¢ Coagulation tests â¢ Vital signs â¢ Physical examinations â¢ ECGs (12-lead) â¢ Pulmonary function tests (spirometry) If the initial dose administered to Cohort 1 is not tolerated, a lower dose cohort may be allowed. In subsequent cohorts, the dose may be decreased from the planned dose depending on results of safety and pharmacokinetic data. Gossamer Bio, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 31 Jul 2018 Page 16 GB002, Inc. Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 352 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final 3.4 Dose Escalation Dose escalation will proceed after the review of all available safety data from subjects in the preceding cohort(s) is completed, the assessment has determined that the prior dose(s) is/are safe, and escalation to the next dose level is recommended. The following factors will be considered for determining the next incremental dose: 1. Observation of clinical adverse effects based on symptoms and signs; 2. Observed abnormalities in clinical chemistries, complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests, or coagulation tests; 3. Pharmacokinetic parameters: maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma versus concentration curve (AUC). 4. For Part A, if no adverse effects are observed at the starting dose , the next dose will be the third dose will be (2 times the second dose), the fourth dose will be up to (up to two times the third dose), and the fifth dose will be up to (one and a half times the fourth dose). 5. For Part B, if no adverse effects are observed at the starting dose regimen (whether QD, BID, or TID), then the next dose will be a mid-dose to be determined by the Safety Review Committee, and if no adverse effects are seen at the mid-dose, then the next dose will be higher dose to be determined by the Safety Review Committee. In the event of adverse effects at a given dose the Safety Review Committee may recommend a decrease in dose for the next dosing cohort. 3.5 Stopping Rules for Dose Escalation The following will result in a decision not to continue dose escalation if judged by the Safety Review Committee to be related to study drug: 1.

Up to 24 subjects will be dosed in Part B of this study. The sample size is not based on statistical considerations. The number of subjects planned for enrollment is considered sufficient to achieve the study objectives. The maximum duration of the study from screening to study exit for each subject will be approximately 39 days for subjects enrolled in Part A and 63 days for subjects enrolled in Part B. Each subject will receive an assigned treatment based on the randomization schedule prepared by the clinical site. In order to achieve gender distribution with a minimum of Gossamer Bio, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 31 Jul 2018 Page 25 GB002, Inc. Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 361 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final 4 females per cohort, and 2 females per active dose group, subjects will be randomized in blocks of 4 by gender. Subjects who successfully qualified for the study but did not dose (for example, backup subjects) may be enrolled in a subsequent cohort if they continue to meet all of the inclusion requirements and none of the exclusion requirements in the timeframe specified. 5.2 Blinding The study will be conducted under double-blind conditions at the Clinical Site. An unblinded pharmacist will be required at the Clinical Site to comply with the studyâs randomization and blinding requirements. At the Clinical Site, prior to study initiation, the Principal Investigator will be responsible for designating a qualified pharmacist to serve as the unblinded pharmacist in the study. At his/her discretion, the Principal Investigator may also designate a back-up unblinded pharmacist. Throughout the study, the unblinded pharmacist will be responsible for all drug accountability issues, including preparing, labeling, and dispensing study drug according to the randomization code provided, yet remain independent of all subject assessments. The unblinded pharmacist will be trained on the requirements of the study and the contents of the Pharmacy Manual. Specific topics covered in the training will include the randomization procedure, drug dispensing procedures, and drug accountability guidelines. Randomization codes will be provided to the unblinded pharmacist. Confirmation of receipt of the randomization code will be required by the Sponsor. The unblinded pharmacist will be responsible for maintaining the blind, consistent with protocol design, throughout the study. All documentation is to be filed in the Pharmacy Manual. Access to this manual by study personnel will be restricted to the unblinded pharmacist and back-up pharmacist (if applicable). The subjects, Principal Investigator, and all other clinical personnel involved with subject assessments will remain blinded to the actual treatment assignments of the subjects (active drug or placebo). The Principal Investigator will be ultimately responsible for ensuring that the integrity of the blind is maintained throughout the study and will be required to notify the Sponsor in the event of any breaking of the blind for any reason. 5.2.1 Staff All observers who evaluate any reported adverse event, laboratory abnormalities, ECGs, and changes in the ECGs will be blinded as to whether the subject is being dosed with active drug or placebo.

Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 362 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final The bioanalytical laboratory and pharmacokineticist will be unblinded to allow for interim analysis between cohorts. 5.2.2 Subjects All subjects will be blinded as to treatment with active drug or placebo. In order to maintain the blind of the study, on the designated dosing days, all subjects will be administered an oral inhalation dose of a study medication. 5.2.3 Unblinding Procedures The treatment assignment should be unblinded to the Principal Investigator or clinical staff prior to completion of the study only in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the study drug assignment is absolutely necessary for the clinical management or welfare of the subject. Breaking of the blind under any other circumstances will be considered a protocol violation. The Investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Sponsor before unblinding the study drug assignment prior to the scheduled assessment of tolerance and safety data. If the blind is broken for any reason, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor within one business day, and an SAE form must be completed, if appropriate. In addition, the Investigator will record the date and reason for revealing the blinded study drug assignment for that subject in the source documents and appropriate CRF page(s). 5.3 Check-In Procedures Subjects will be admitted to the research facility on the day prior to study drug administration. The following procedures will be completed following admission to the unit: â¢ All subjects will be asked to affirm that the exclusion criteria and restrictions have not been violated since the screening. â¢ Review concomitant medications â¢ Assess for adverse events â¢ Collect blood for serum chemistry, hematology (complete blood count), and coagulation testing â¢ Collect urine for urinalysis â¢ Collect urine for drug, alcohol, and cotinine testing â¢ Spirometry â¢ Collect urine for pregnancy testing (female subjects only) Gossamer Bio, Inc.

The Investigator or a medically qualified designee will review each event. The Investigator or a Sub-Investigator will assess its relationship to the study drug. Each sign or symptom will be graded for severity, and the date and time of onset, cessation and resolution will be recorded. Treatment of any adverse reactions will be evaluated and managed by a physician, either at the study site or at a nearby hospital emergency room, as appropriate. All non-serious AEs will be reported on a regular basis or as specified by the Sponsor. 6.1 Definitions 6.1.1 Adverse Event An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without judgment to causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (eg, use in combinations with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 6.1.2 Serious Adverse Event/Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction A serious AE (SAE) or serious suspected adverse reaction, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 6.1.3 Life-Threatening Adverse Event/Life-Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction A life-threatening AE/life-threatening suspected adverse reaction, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. Gossamer Bio, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 31 Jul 2018 Page 35 GB002, Inc. Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 371 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final 6.1.4 Unexpected Adverse Event/Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction An unexpected AE/unexpected suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected adverse reaction that is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. 6.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting The Investigator or designee will notify the appropriate sponsor contact immediately after the SAE detection, observation, or report of occurrence (regardless of the relationship to test article).

All AEs and treatment administered will be recorded on the case report form (CRF). The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting and processing any SAEs to the FDA or other applicable regulatory agency. 6.3 Relationship to Study Treatment The relationship between the AE and the investigational product will be determined by the Principal Investigator or Sub-Investigator on the basis of his/her clinical judgment and the following definitions: Related: The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study product administration, and cannot be reasonably explained by the subjectâs clinical state or other factors (e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, or concomitant medications). The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study product administration, and represents a known reaction to the drug under study or other drugs in its class, or is predicted by the known pharmacological properties of the drug. The AE resolves with discontinuation of the investigational product and/or recurs with rechallenge, if applicable. Possibly Related: An AE may be considered possibly related if or when (at least two of the following): â¢ It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study product; â¢ It could not readily have been produced by the subjectâs clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. â¢ It follows a known pattern of response to the study product.

The samples from all evaluable subjects who complete their study period will be analyzed. 8.2 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Pharmacokinetic parameters for PK10571will be calculated using non-compartmental analysis. The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined: The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax (Tmax) will be taken directly from the data. The elimination rate constant, Î»z, will be calculated as the negative of the slope of the terminal log-linear segment of the plasma concentration-time curve; the range of data to be used will be determined by visual inspection of a semi-logarithmic plot of concentration vs. time. Elimination half-life (TÂ½) will be calculated according to the following equation: TÂ½ = 0.693 / Î»Z Area under the curve to the final sample with a concentration greater than the limit of quantitation (LOQ), (AUClast), will be calculated using the log trapezoidal method and extrapolated to infinity using: AUCinf = AUClast + Clast/ Î»Z where Clast is the final concentration â¥LOQ. All evaluable subjects will be included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. Pharmacokinetic calculations will be performed using appropriate software, e.g. Phoenixâ¢ WinNonlinÂ® (Version 6.3 or higher, Pharsight Corporation) and/or SASÂ® (Version 9.3 or higher, SAS Institute Inc.). 8.3 Statistical Analysis Comparison of the log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUClast, and AUCinf for PK10571across treatments will be performed using an ANOVA model and the two one-sided t-tests procedure. The ANOVA model will include factors for subject, treatment, and cohort. The ratios of the geometric means and 90% confidence intervals will be reported. Statistical analyses will be performed using appropriate software, e.g. Phoenixâ¢ WinNonlinÂ® (Version 6.3 or higher, Pharsight Corporation) and/or SASÂ® (Version 9.4 or higher, SAS Institute Inc.).

EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS: BD VacutainerÂ® Blood Collection Set (BD Cat#367352) BD Vaucatainer Cell preparation tube (CPT) with sodium citrate (BD Cat#362761) Pasteur Pipettes 15ml conical tubes 1 x PBS with 0.5% v/v Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma #P0044) Centrifuge â capable of producing ~10,000 x g PROCEDURES: A) Collection of Blood in BD VacutainerÂ® CPT with sodium citrate (cat# 362761) NOTE: Gloves should be worn for venipuncture procedure. 1. Open the blood collection needle package (BD Cat#367352) but do not remove needle shield. 2. Insert blood collection tube (BD Vacutainer CPT with sodium citrate; Cat#362761) into holder. (Do not in puncture the diaphragm of the stopper of CPT tube). 3. Select site for venipuncture. 4. Apply tourniquet. Prepare venipuncture site with an appropriate antiseptic. 5. Remove needle shield. Perform venipuncture with patientâs arm in a downward position and tube stopper uppermost. This reduces the risk of backflow of any anticoagulant into the patient's circulation. 6. Push the CPT tube onto needle of the holder, puncturing diaphragm of stopper. 7. Remove tourniquet as soon as blood appears in the tube. 8. Draw ~8 ml of blood in the BD Vacutainer CPT, remove the tube from the holder. 9. If a multiple sample needle is being used, remove the tube and place a new tube into the holder. 10. If the second tube does not draw, remove needle and discard in appropriate disposal device. Repeat procedure from step 1. Gossamer Bio, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 31 Jul 2018 Page 57 GB002, Inc. Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 393 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final 11. Remove needle from vein. Apply pressure to puncture site with dry, sterile gauze until bleeding stops. 12. Apply bandage, if desired. 13. After collection, dispose of needle using an appropriate disposal device.â¨Do not reshield. 14. Invert the blood-filled tube 8 to 10 times to mix anticoagulant additive with blood.â¨Do not shake. Vigorous mixing can cause hemolysis. B) Isolation of Buffy Coat Cells (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs)) 1. Centrifuge the sample tubes at 1500 x g for 20 minutes at 18-25 Â°C. (Note: It is critical to centrifuge the sample tubes within 5 minutes, as waiting for a longer period of time may cause red blood cell lysis as well as affect the phosphorylation state of protein) 2. After centrifugation, the buffy coat of mononuclear cells will be visible just under the plasma layer. Aspirate approximately half of the plasma without disturbing the buffy coat cell layer using a Pasteur pipette. Collect buffy coat cell layer with a Pasteur pipette and transfer to a 15 mL size conical centrifuge tube with cap. (6-8 ml of blood will give a yield of ~3ml of buffy coat) 3. Add 10 ml of 1 x PBS containing 0.5% Phosphatase Inhibitor cocktail (Sigma; Cat#P0044). Mix cells by inverting tube 5 times. 4. Centrifuge for 15 minutes at 300 RCF. Aspirate as much supernatant as possible without disturbing cell pellet. 5. Immediately after step 4 (within 1 minutes), freeze on dry ice, then store the cell pellet at -80Â°C until shipped. 6. Ship on Dry Ice (a sufficient amount to last at least 4 days) by overnight courier to Sponsor after full cohort collection complete. Communicate with sponsor before shipment to pre-arrange shipment date.

If the decision is made to start dosing in the MAD protocol at BID, then the Safety Review Committee will review the safety data (including local irritation) and PK data from the first MAD cohort to determine if BID dosing should continue, if dosing should be reduced to QD, or if dosing should be increased to TID for the next cohort. Blood Sampling, Processing and Shipment A total of 180 mL (30 x 6 mL samples) will be collected from each subject in Part B for pharmacokinetic analysis. In addition, approximately 173.5 mL of blood will be collected for laboratory evaluations. The total volume of blood collected from each subject will not exceed approximately 353.5 mL. Additional blood may be collected if necessary for repeat laboratory evaluations or AE follow up. Blood samples collected up to and including 24 hours postdose within Â± 2 minutes of scheduled time will not be considered deviations. Blood samples collected after 24 hours through 48 hours after the last dose within Â± 5 minutes of scheduled time will not be considered deviations. Blood samples collected after 48 hours postdose after the last dose within Â± 10 minutes of scheduled time will not be considered deviations.

Despite recent advances in vasodilator therapy for PAH, more effective treatments are needed. PK10571 has not been previously studied in humans. 1.1.1 Pharmacology PK10571 is a potent and selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor which has shown efficacy in animal models of PAH. The following studies of PK10571 have been performed: â¢ In vitro kinase assays â¢ In-cell Westerns to measure inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGFBB) stimulated AKT (also known as protein kinase B) phosphorylation â¢ Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to estimate IC50 for inhibition of phosphorylation of PDGF receptors in human lung fibroblasts â¢ Endothelial cell permeability assays â¢ Human ether-Ã -go-go-related gene (hERG) channel activity assay â¢ Metabolism study in human hepatocytes â¢ Biliary excretion study â¢ Metabolism in lung microsomes â¢ Preclinical efficacy study in the rat monocrotaline plus pneumonectomy model â¢ Preclinical efficacy study in the rat Sugen 5416 (SU5416) hypoxia model â¢ Platelet aggregation studies PK10571is well absorbed from the lung in both rats and dogs and accumulation did not appear to be an issue in either species.

Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 343 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final 1.2 Dose Selection Rationale The first in human exposure of PK10571 will be a single dose ranging study followed by multiple dose (7 day) administration in healthy volunteers. The results from the preclinical program were used to select the starting dose for this phase IA clinical trial. The starting dose is based on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Guidance for Industry âEstimating the Maximum Safe Starting Dose in Initial Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteersâ dated July 2005.

Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 346 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final Escalation will be carried out with careful clinical monitoring and in accordance with dose escalation and halting rules described in the protocol. It should be noted that if a higher maximum dose of is warranted in the clinical trial, the nonclinical data would also support this dose with an animal:human dose multiple of 15. 1.3 Study Rationale Because PAH represents a serious orphan medical condition with a critical need for better therapies, Gossamer Bio, Inc. plans to work closely with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in order to ensure an efficient development program. Gossamer Bio, Inc. will evaluate PK10571 in an initial Phase 1A single-dose/multiple-dose study in normal, healthy volunteers, . Part A of the phase 1A study is a single ascending dose (SAD) double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial of inhaled dry powder PK10571 in healthy human volunteers for determination of safety. Part A will consist of at least 4 cohorts and up to 5 cohorts. Within each cohort, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either active drug or placebo. The initial dose will be determined based on the results of animal toxicology studies. After completion and review of the SAD trial (Part A), the multiple ascending dose (MAD) clinical trial (Part B) will be performed. The MAD clinical trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized repeat dose trial of inhaled dry powder PK10571 in healthy human volunteers. There will be up to 3 dose cohorts, and within each cohort subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either active drug or placebo. Study subjects will be administered active drug or placebo once daily for 7 days. Gossamer Bio, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 31 Jul 2018 Page 11 GB002, Inc. Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 347 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final 2 OBJECTIVES The objectives of this study are: â¢ To determine the safety and tolerability of single ascending inhalation doses of PK10571 formulated as a dry powder with excipient L-leucine in healthy adult subjects (Part A) â¢ To determine the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending inhalation doses of PK10571 formulated as a dry powder with excipient L-leucine in healthy adult subjects (Part B) â¢ To evaluate the bioavailability of PK10571 following single- and multiple-dose regimens â¢ 3 STUDY DESIGN SUMMARY This is a first-in-human, single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-part study in healthy adult males and females of non-childbearing potential. Because the safety profile of PK10571 in humans is unknown and this is the first clinical study to assess PK10571 in humans, a single-ascending dose escalation design will be used in Part A of the study. Part B will be a multiple-ascending dose escalation design, to be run only after review of safety and pharmacokinetic data from Part A. In the single ascending dose study (Part A) at least 4 dose levels of PK10571 will be tested: An optional fifth dose level of up to may be added, based on safety and pharmacokinetic data from the first 4 cohorts. Subjects will be randomized into one dose cohort and receive either PK10571 or placebo. Within each cohort, 6 subjects will receive active drug and 2 subjects will receive placebo. In the multiple ascending dose study (Part B), up to three dose levels of PK10571 will be tested. The daily dose will be administered daily for 7 days with close clinical monitoring. The dose for the first cohort of Part B will be determined by review of the safety and pharmacokinetic data from Part A by the Safety Review Committee. The dose interval for the first cohort of Part B (i.e., once daily, twice daily, or up to three times daily) will be determined by review of the safety and pharmacokinetic data from Part A by the Safety Review committee. Subsequent doses and dosing intervals will be determined by review of the safety and pharmacokinetic data from the prior cohort. Gossamer Bio, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 31 Jul 2018 Page 12 GB002, Inc. Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 348 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final For both Part A and Part B, for each cohort, randomization will occur in 2 blocks as follows: In the first block, 2 subjects (sentinel subjects) will be randomized 1:1 to receive PK10571 or placebo; in the second block, 6 subjects will be randomized 5 PK10571: 1 placebo. If PK10571 is well-tolerated in the sentinel subjects, the remainder of the cohort (n = 6) will be randomized. There will be a minimum of 48 hours between dosing of the 2 sentinel subjects and the remainder of the cohort. The safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of PK10571 will be evaluated in each sequential cohort prior to each dose cohort escalation, assessing the totality of all the safety data prior to initiating the next cohort. Gender distribution will be based on sequential screening of volunteers who meet entry criteria, with a minimum of 4 females per cohort, in order to ensure 2 females per active dose group. Subjects will be assigned numbers in an ascending order, based on successful completion of the screening process. Each subject will participate in only one cohort. Subjects who withdraw from the study may be replaced at the discretion of the Principal Investigator and Sponsor. Replacement subjects will be given a new randomization number in the 9000 series and assigned to the same treatment as the subject they replace. Safety assessments will include adverse events; vital signs; oxygen saturation; physical examination; 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG); clinical laboratory examinations; and pulmonary function tests (spirometry). Blood and urine will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Blood will be collected for buffy coat analysis. 3.1 Part A Part A of the study is a single ascending dose study design. Up to 5 dose levels will be studied. Subjects will receive either PK10571 or placebo. Part A will enroll up to 40 subjects; 8 subjects per cohort. The data from each cohort will be analyzed before deciding whether to proceed with the next cohort. Each cohort will include a sentinel group of 2 subjects (1 active and 1 placebo) who will be dosed at least 48 hours before the remaining subjects (5 active and 1 placebo). Dosing of the remaining subjects will occur following a safety evaluation of the sentinel group. Gossamer Bio, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 31 Jul 2018 Page 13 GB002, Inc. Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 349 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final Subjects will receive one of the treatments listed in Table 1. Within each cohort, subjects will be assigned to either active treatment or placebo in randomized fashion.

Â¶ Capsules with a nominal fill weight of will be administered to achieve the dose for cohort 4 (nominal 18 mg FPD (5 capsules) Î¡ The capsule fill weight, FPD, and number of capsules to be administered will be determined to achieve the target dose for cohort 5, if the Safety Review Committee decides to proceed with this dose. Each dose will be administered using an oral inhalation device following a 10-hour overnight fast. After dosing, no food will be allowed until 4 hours postdose. Meals will be standard and scheduled at approximately the same times relative to dose for each cohort. No water may be consumed for 1 hour prior through 1 hour after dose, except for 60 mL of room temperature water which will be given to subjects to rinse their mouths after dosing. Subjects will swish the 60 mL of water in their mouths then spit it out. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic evaluation will be obtained prior to dose administration and following dose administration at selected times through 48 hours postdose. A total of 14 pharmacokinetic blood samples will be collected from each subject. Plasma pharmacokinetic samples will be analyzed for PK10571 using a validated analytical method. Appropriate pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated for each formulation using non-compartmental methods. Subjects will be housed at the clinical research site for observation for 3 days and then followed up by phone daily for the next 7 days. Subjects will return to the clinical research site for a safety evaluation on Day 11. 3.2 Part B Part B is a multiple ascending dose study design. Subjects will receive either PK10571 or placebo. Approximately 24 subjects will be enrolled in Part B. Subjects will be enrolled in 3 cohorts of 8 subjects each. Gossamer Bio, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 31 Jul 2018 Page 14 GB002, Inc. Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 350 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final The initial dose for Part B will be determined after review of the safety and pharmacokinetic data from Part A by the Safety Review Committee. Data from the lower dose cohort will be analyzed before deciding whether to proceed with the higher dose cohort. Alternatively, a lower dose may be administered, depending upon review of previous cohortâs safety and pharmacokinetic data. Subjects will receive one of the treatments listed in Table 3. The assigned treatment will be given either as a single daily dose (QD), or divided into two daily doses (BID), or divided into three daily doses (TID; each dose to be separated by 6 hours on a given day). Subjects will be assigned to either active treatment or placebo in randomized fashion.

Subjects will be housed at the clinical research site for observation until Day 9 (48 hours after the last dose) and return to the clinical research site for safety evaluation and pharmacokinetic blood collection on Days 10, 14, and 35. 3.3 Safety Review Team A Safety Review Committee consisting of the Principal Investigator or designee (e.g., a medically qualified sub-investigator) and Sponsor representatives with appropriate expertise will meet and review, at minimum, the 24-hour safety data for the sentinel group of each cohort in Part A prior to dosing the remainder of the cohort. The Safety Review Committee will review the safety and pharmacokinetic data from each cohort in Part A. Dose escalation to the next level will occur only after review of the 24-hour pharmacokinetic data, and safety data up to and including Day 11 from the preceding cohort(s). The factors to be used in determining the next incremental dose are described in Section 3.4. There will be at least 2 weeks between dosing of each cohort. The Safety Review Committee will review the safety and pharmacokinetic data of Part A before starting Part B. The pharmacokinetic data from the first 24 hours of Part B, Cohort 1 up to and including Day 7, and the safety data up to and including Day 14 will be reviewed prior to dosing of Part B, Cohort 2. All available safety data will be assessed prior to each dose escalation, including but not limited to the following: â¢ All adverse events (AEs) â¢ Safety laboratory tests (i.e., hematology, chemistry and urinalysis) â¢ Coagulation tests â¢ Vital signs â¢ Physical examinations â¢ ECGs (12-lead) â¢ Pulmonary function tests (spirometry) If the initial dose administered to Cohort 1 is not tolerated, a lower dose cohort may be allowed. In subsequent cohorts, the dose may be decreased from the planned dose depending on results of safety and pharmacokinetic data. Gossamer Bio, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 31 Jul 2018 Page 16 GB002, Inc. Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 352 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final 3.4 Dose Escalation Dose escalation will proceed after the review of all available safety data from subjects in the preceding cohort(s) is completed, the assessment has determined that the prior dose(s) is/are safe, and escalation to the next dose level is recommended. The following factors will be considered for determining the next incremental dose: 1. Observation of clinical adverse effects based on symptoms and signs; 2. Observed abnormalities in clinical chemistries, complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests, or coagulation tests; 3. Pharmacokinetic parameters: maximum concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma versus concentration curve (AUC). 4. For Part A, if no adverse effects are observed at the starting dose , the next dose will be the third dose will be (2 times the second dose), the fourth dose will be up to (up to two times the third dose), and the fifth dose will be up to (one and a half times the fourth dose). 5. For Part B, if no adverse effects are observed at the starting dose regimen (whether QD, BID, or TID), then the next dose will be a mid-dose to be determined by the Safety Review Committee, and if no adverse effects are seen at the mid-dose, then the next dose will be higher dose to be determined by the Safety Review Committee. In the event of adverse effects at a given dose the Safety Review Committee may recommend a decrease in dose for the next dosing cohort. 3.5 Stopping Rules for Dose Escalation The following will result in a decision not to continue dose escalation if judged by the Safety Review Committee to be related to study drug: 1. Onset of respiratory symptoms postdose suspected to be related to study medication including but not limited to bronchospasm (wheezing), stridor, clinically significant moderate dyspnea, oxygen desaturation with dyspnea, evidence of significant airflow obstruction on spirometry in at least 2 subjects. 2.

Each subject will receive an assigned treatment based on the randomization schedule prepared by the clinical site. In order to achieve gender distribution with a minimum of Gossamer Bio, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 31 Jul 2018 Page 25 GB002, Inc. Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 361 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final 4 females per cohort, and 2 females per active dose group, subjects will be randomized in blocks of 4 by gender. Subjects who successfully qualified for the study but did not dose (for example, backup subjects) may be enrolled in a subsequent cohort if they continue to meet all of the inclusion requirements and none of the exclusion requirements in the timeframe specified. 5.2 Blinding The study will be conducted under double-blind conditions at the Clinical Site. An unblinded pharmacist will be required at the Clinical Site to comply with the studyâs randomization and blinding requirements. At the Clinical Site, prior to study initiation, the Principal Investigator will be responsible for designating a qualified pharmacist to serve as the unblinded pharmacist in the study. At his/her discretion, the Principal Investigator may also designate a back-up unblinded pharmacist. Throughout the study, the unblinded pharmacist will be responsible for all drug accountability issues, including preparing, labeling, and dispensing study drug according to the randomization code provided, yet remain independent of all subject assessments. The unblinded pharmacist will be trained on the requirements of the study and the contents of the Pharmacy Manual. Specific topics covered in the training will include the randomization procedure, drug dispensing procedures, and drug accountability guidelines. Randomization codes will be provided to the unblinded pharmacist. Confirmation of receipt of the randomization code will be required by the Sponsor. The unblinded pharmacist will be responsible for maintaining the blind, consistent with protocol design, throughout the study. All documentation is to be filed in the Pharmacy Manual. Access to this manual by study personnel will be restricted to the unblinded pharmacist and back-up pharmacist (if applicable). The subjects, Principal Investigator, and all other clinical personnel involved with subject assessments will remain blinded to the actual treatment assignments of the subjects (active drug or placebo). The Principal Investigator will be ultimately responsible for ensuring that the integrity of the blind is maintained throughout the study and will be required to notify the Sponsor in the event of any breaking of the blind for any reason. 5.2.1 Staff All observers who evaluate any reported adverse event, laboratory abnormalities, ECGs, and changes in the ECGs will be blinded as to whether the subject is being dosed with active drug or placebo.

Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 362 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final The bioanalytical laboratory and pharmacokineticist will be unblinded to allow for interim analysis between cohorts. 5.2.2 Subjects All subjects will be blinded as to treatment with active drug or placebo. In order to maintain the blind of the study, on the designated dosing days, all subjects will be administered an oral inhalation dose of a study medication. 5.2.3 Unblinding Procedures The treatment assignment should be unblinded to the Principal Investigator or clinical staff prior to completion of the study only in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of the study drug assignment is absolutely necessary for the clinical management or welfare of the subject. Breaking of the blind under any other circumstances will be considered a protocol violation. The Investigator is strongly encouraged to contact the Sponsor before unblinding the study drug assignment prior to the scheduled assessment of tolerance and safety data. If the blind is broken for any reason, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor within one business day, and an SAE form must be completed, if appropriate. In addition, the Investigator will record the date and reason for revealing the blinded study drug assignment for that subject in the source documents and appropriate CRF page(s). 5.3 Check-In Procedures Subjects will be admitted to the research facility on the day prior to study drug administration. The following procedures will be completed following admission to the unit: â¢ All subjects will be asked to affirm that the exclusion criteria and restrictions have not been violated since the screening. â¢ Review concomitant medications â¢ Assess for adverse events â¢ Collect blood for serum chemistry, hematology (complete blood count), and coagulation testing â¢ Collect urine for urinalysis â¢ Collect urine for drug, alcohol, and cotinine testing â¢ Spirometry â¢ Collect urine for pregnancy testing (female subjects only) Gossamer Bio, Inc.

The Investigator or a medically qualified designee will review each event. The Investigator or a Sub-Investigator will assess its relationship to the study drug. Each sign or symptom will be graded for severity, and the date and time of onset, cessation and resolution will be recorded. Treatment of any adverse reactions will be evaluated and managed by a physician, either at the study site or at a nearby hospital emergency room, as appropriate. All non-serious AEs will be reported on a regular basis or as specified by the Sponsor. 6.1 Definitions 6.1.1 Adverse Event An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without judgment to causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (eg, use in combinations with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 6.1.2 Serious Adverse Event/Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction A serious AE (SAE) or serious suspected adverse reaction, in the view of either the investigator or Sponsor, results in any of the following outcomes: Death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. 6.1.3 Life-Threatening Adverse Event/Life-Threatening Suspected Adverse Reaction A life-threatening AE/life-threatening suspected adverse reaction, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, places the patient or subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. Gossamer Bio, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 31 Jul 2018 Page 35 GB002, Inc. Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 371 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final 6.1.4 Unexpected Adverse Event/Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction An unexpected AE/unexpected suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected adverse reaction that is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as amended. 6.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting The Investigator or designee will notify the appropriate sponsor contact immediately after the SAE detection, observation, or report of occurrence (regardless of the relationship to test article).

Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 372 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final Any new SAE that occurs within one month after the study period and is considered to be possibly related to the Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) should be recorded and reported immediately to the Sponsor. The person responsible for the study shall take care that the study has been carried out in accordance with pharmacovigilance local regulations. All serious event reporting will adhere to 21 CFR 312.32 for IND drugs and 21 CFR 314.80 for marketed drugs (15-day alerts). The Institutional Review Board (IRB) will be notified of the alert reports per FDA regulations. All AEs, including SAEs, will be followed to resolution when possible. All AEs and treatment administered will be recorded on the case report form (CRF). The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting and processing any SAEs to the FDA or other applicable regulatory agency. 6.3 Relationship to Study Treatment The relationship between the AE and the investigational product will be determined by the Principal Investigator or Sub-Investigator on the basis of his/her clinical judgment and the following definitions: Related: The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study product administration, and cannot be reasonably explained by the subjectâs clinical state or other factors (e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, or concomitant medications). The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study product administration, and represents a known reaction to the drug under study or other drugs in its class, or is predicted by the known pharmacological properties of the drug. The AE resolves with discontinuation of the investigational product and/or recurs with rechallenge, if applicable. Possibly Related: An AE may be considered possibly related if or when (at least two of the following): â¢ It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the study product; â¢ It could not readily have been produced by the subjectâs clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of therapy administered to the subject. â¢ It follows a known pattern of response to the study product.

The samples from all evaluable subjects who complete their study period will be analyzed. 8.2 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Pharmacokinetic parameters for PK10571will be calculated using non-compartmental analysis. The following pharmacokinetic parameters will be determined: The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and time to Cmax (Tmax) will be taken directly from the data. The elimination rate constant, Î»z, will be calculated as the negative of the slope of the terminal log-linear segment of the plasma concentration-time curve; the range of data to be used will be determined by visual inspection of a semi-logarithmic plot of concentration vs. time. Elimination half-life (TÂ½) will be calculated according to the following equation: TÂ½ = 0.693 / Î»Z Area under the curve to the final sample with a concentration greater than the limit of quantitation (LOQ), (AUClast), will be calculated using the log trapezoidal method and extrapolated to infinity using: AUCinf = AUClast + Clast/ Î»Z where Clast is the final concentration â¥LOQ. All evaluable subjects will be included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. Pharmacokinetic calculations will be performed using appropriate software, e.g. Phoenixâ¢ WinNonlinÂ® (Version 6.3 or higher, Pharsight Corporation) and/or SASÂ® (Version 9.3 or higher, SAS Institute Inc.). 8.3 Statistical Analysis Comparison of the log-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUClast, and AUCinf for PK10571across treatments will be performed using an ANOVA model and the two one-sided t-tests procedure. The ANOVA model will include factors for subject, treatment, and cohort. The ratios of the geometric means and 90% confidence intervals will be reported. Statistical analyses will be performed using appropriate software, e.g. Phoenixâ¢ WinNonlinÂ® (Version 6.3 or higher, Pharsight Corporation) and/or SASÂ® (Version 9.4 or higher, SAS Institute Inc.).

EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS: BD VacutainerÂ® Blood Collection Set (BD Cat#367352) BD Vaucatainer Cell preparation tube (CPT) with sodium citrate (BD Cat#362761) Pasteur Pipettes 15ml conical tubes 1 x PBS with 0.5% v/v Phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Sigma #P0044) Centrifuge â capable of producing ~10,000 x g PROCEDURES: A) Collection of Blood in BD VacutainerÂ® CPT with sodium citrate (cat# 362761) NOTE: Gloves should be worn for venipuncture procedure. 1. Open the blood collection needle package (BD Cat#367352) but do not remove needle shield. 2. Insert blood collection tube (BD Vacutainer CPT with sodium citrate; Cat#362761) into holder. (Do not in puncture the diaphragm of the stopper of CPT tube). 3. Select site for venipuncture. 4. Apply tourniquet. Prepare venipuncture site with an appropriate antiseptic. 5. Remove needle shield. Perform venipuncture with patientâs arm in a downward position and tube stopper uppermost. This reduces the risk of backflow of any anticoagulant into the patient's circulation. 6. Push the CPT tube onto needle of the holder, puncturing diaphragm of stopper. 7. Remove tourniquet as soon as blood appears in the tube. 8. Draw ~8 ml of blood in the BD Vacutainer CPT, remove the tube from the holder. 9. If a multiple sample needle is being used, remove the tube and place a new tube into the holder. 10. If the second tube does not draw, remove needle and discard in appropriate disposal device. Repeat procedure from step 1. Gossamer Bio, Inc. CONFIDENTIAL 31 Jul 2018 Page 57 GB002, Inc. Protocol 4004002 Appendix 16.1.1 - Page 393 Protocol 4004002 V.5.3 Final 11. Remove needle from vein. Apply pressure to puncture site with dry, sterile gauze until bleeding stops. 12. Apply bandage, if desired. 13. After collection, dispose of needle using an appropriate disposal device.\\u2028Do not reshield. 14. Invert the blood-filled tube 8 to 10 times to mix anticoagulant additive with blood.\\u2028Do not shake. Vigorous mixing can cause hemolysis. B) Isolation of Buffy Coat Cells (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs)) 1. Centrifuge the sample tubes at 1500 x g for 20 minutes at 18-25 Â°C. (Note: It is critical to centrifuge the sample tubes within 5 minutes, as waiting for a longer period of time may cause red blood cell lysis as well as affect the phosphorylation state of protein) 2. After centrifugation, the buffy coat of mononuclear cells will be visible just under the plasma layer. Aspirate approximately half of the plasma without disturbing the buffy coat cell layer using a Pasteur pipette. Collect buffy coat cell layer with a Pasteur pipette and transfer to a 15 mL size conical centrifuge tube with cap. (6-8 ml of blood will give a yield of ~3ml of buffy coat) 3. Add 10 ml of 1 x PBS containing 0.5% Phosphatase Inhibitor cocktail (Sigma; Cat#P0044). Mix cells by inverting tube 5 times. 4. Centrifuge for 15 minutes at 300 RCF. Aspirate as much supernatant as possible without disturbing cell pellet. 5. Immediately after step 4 (within 1 minutes), freeze on dry ice, then store the cell pellet at -80Â°C until shipped. 6. Ship on Dry Ice (a sufficient amount to last at least 4 days) by overnight courier to Sponsor after full cohort collection complete. Communicate with sponsor before shipment to pre-arrange shipment date.

If the decision is made to start dosing in the MAD protocol at BID, then the Safety Review Committee will review the safety data (including local irritation) and PK data from the first MAD cohort to determine if BID dosing should continue, if dosing should be reduced to QD, or if dosing should be increased to TID for the next cohort. Blood Sampling, Processing and Shipment A total of 180 mL (30 x 6 mL samples) will be collected from each subject in Part B for pharmacokinetic analysis. In addition, approximately 173.5 mL of blood will be collected for laboratory evaluations. The total volume of blood collected from each subject will not exceed approximately 353.5 mL. Additional blood may be collected if necessary for repeat laboratory evaluations or AE follow up. Blood samples collected up to and including 24 hours postdose within Â± 2 minutes of scheduled time will not be considered deviations. Blood samples collected after 24 hours through 48 hours after the last dose within Â± 5 minutes of scheduled time will not be considered deviations.

Similarly, if the starting dose in the MAD protocol is BID, then the Safety Review Committee will review the safety data (including local irritation) and PK data from the first MAD cohort to determine if BID dosing should continue, or if dosing should be changed to QD or TID for the next cohort. Blood Sampling, Processing and Shipment A total of 180 mL (30 x 6 mL samples) will be collected from each subject in Part B for pharmacokinetic analysis. In addition, approximately 173.5 mL of blood will be collected for laboratory evaluations. The total volume of blood collected from each subject will not exceed approximately 353.5 mL. Additional blood may be collected if necessary for repeat laboratory evaluations or AE follow up. Blood samples collected up to and including 24 hours postdose within Â± 2 minutes of scheduled time will not be considered deviations. Blood samples collected after 24 hours through 48 hours after the last dose within Â± 5 minutes of scheduled time will not be considered deviations.
